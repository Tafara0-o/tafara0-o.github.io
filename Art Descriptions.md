# Selected Works with Descriptions

---

## God Bless The Black Girl I  
**Medium:** Charcoal on paper  
**Dimensions:** 42 cm × 60 cm  
**Year:** 2021  

The opening work of a series dedicated to Black femininity, this charcoal portrait honors the resilience, grace, and quiet power of Black girls. Through hyperrealistic rendering, Tafara captures not just facial features but an interior strength, a presence that carries galaxies on its back. This inaugural piece establishes the visual language that would evolve across the series: meticulous attention to texture, skin tone, and the subtle dignity inherent in everyday presence. It marks the beginning of Tafara's deliberate shift toward centering marginalized narratives through contemporary portraiture.

## God Bless The Black Girl II  
**Medium:** Charcoal on paper  
**Dimensions:** 42 cm × 60 cm  
**Year:** 2021  

Continuing the series' meditation on Black feminine beauty and heritage, this portrait deepens the exploration of cultural identity and grace. Through refined charcoal technique, Tafara renders not merely a face but an archive of ancestry, the visible inheritance of resilience written into skin, gaze, and posture. Each piece in this series functions as a visual prayer, an acknowledgment that ordinary girls possess extraordinary spiritual and emotional fortitude.  

---

## God Bless The Black Girl III  
**Medium:** Charcoal on paper  
**Dimensions:** 42 cm × 60 cm  
**Year:** 2021  

This contemplative work further articulates the series' central thesis: that Black girls are nature's grace, born from struggle and destined to lead. The charcoal rendering captures a moment of introspection, inviting viewers to witness not performance or pageantry, but the authentic interiority of a young Black woman, her thoughts, her strength, her right to complexity.

## God Bless The Black Girl IV  
**Medium:** Pastels and newspaper on paper  
**Dimensions:** 42 cm × 60 cm  
**Year:** 2021  

A pivotal work marking Tafara's transition from charcoal to pastels. This piece introduces the artist's signature methodology: embedding newspaper clippings and textual fragments directly into the composition. In this case, the background features stories documenting gender-based violence, activism, and survivor narratives, sourced from public discourse yet typically invisible or unread. By juxtaposing the intimate beauty of a Black woman's portrait with these urgent testimonies, Tafara creates a visual argument: that personal dignity and collective struggle are inseparable. The richer chromatic palette of pastels allows greater emotional depth, while the newspaper fragments give voice to the systemic violences that Black women endure. This work demonstrated that Tafara's medium could carry both aesthetic and narrative weight simultaneously.

## Plight of Man  
**Medium:** Charcoal on paper  
**Dimensions:** 60 cm × 84 cm  
**Year:** 2021  
**Award:** National Gallery of Zimbabwe, 1st Place  

This monumental work catalyzed Tafara's conceptual pivot toward centering male vulnerability. Anchored by C. Aaron's poem, which speaks to the paradox of liberation without freedom, strength demanded at the cost of emotional death, this charcoal portrait becomes a visual manifesto. The figure depicted carries the weight of societal expectation: the demand to "man up," to endure trauma silently, to wear dignity as armor while drowning internally. Through hyperrealistic rendering, Tafara refuses to aestheticize this suffering; instead, he insists upon its visibility. The darkness, the compression, the yearning evident in the figure's expression all point toward a singular truth: that masculinity as currently constructed is a cage, and that men deserve the freedom to be delicate, to cry, to seek help without losing their humanity. This piece won national recognition precisely because it articulated what few were willing to say—that the "plight of man" is not weakness, but the systematic denial of emotional freedom. It marked the artist's emergence as a storyteller willing to center difficult truths about gender, power, and survival.

## Self Introspection  
**Medium:** Pastel on paper  
**Dimensions:** 84 cm × 60 cm  
**Year:** 2021  

A self-portrait and technical turning point. This work documents Tafara's first confident exploration of pastels as a primary medium. Beyond its autobiographical dimension, this piece serves as a meditation on artistic practice itself, the moment of looking inward, of questioning one's own capacity, of sitting with doubt and emerging with clarity. The soft, layered pastels allow for chromatic subtlety that charcoal cannot achieve, enabling the artist to render not just physical likeness but psychological texture. This work was essential: it gave Tafara permission to trust his intuitive, unorthodox relationship with materials, and to recognize that technical mastery could coexist with emotional vulnerability.

## maChange Money pa Touchline (Money Changers at the Touchline)  
**Medium:** Pastel and newspaper on board  
**Dimensions:** 100 cm × 70 cm  
**Year:** 2023  

Inspired by Grant Wood's *American Gothic*, this monumental work transposes classical social realism into a contemporary Zimbabwean context. Two street money changers are positioned in Wood's iconic pose, a visual gesture that reclaims Renaissance and early modern artistic language for contemporary Black subjects. The figures call out their trade: "tochinja here, swipe ecocash, mabond", the vernacular language of informal economy, rendered with the dignity typically reserved for nobility or mythological figures. The dark pastel palette evokes both the bleakness of black market economies and the psychological weight of economic precarity. Crucially, newspaper clippings embedded throughout the composition document police harassment, municipal council violence, and the systemic marginalization of street vendors. The Adinkra symbol *Mmer Dane* ("times change") signals both temporal flux and the possibility of transformation. This work directly intervenes in art historical narrative, asserting that ordinary Black men, those society renders invisible or criminal—deserve to be painted like Renaissance sovereigns. It was exhibited at the National Gallery of Zimbabwe and represents a watershed moment in the artist's practice: the marriage of classical technique with urgent social commentary.

## Mununuri weMhuri (Savior of the Family)  
**Medium:** Pastel and newspaper on board  
**Dimensions:** 100 cm × 70 cm  
**Year:** 2024  

Inspired by Leonardo da Vinci's *Salvator Mundi*, this work reinterprets one of Western art history's most iconic religious compositions through a contemporary Zimbabwean lens. A street vendor, photographed by Tafara in his community, becomes the "savior," repositioned as a figure of spiritual and economic significance. The dark pastel palette underscores the dystopian reality of informal economy: vendors evading City Council chases, their goods confiscated, their labor criminalized by state machinery. Yet the work's title insists upon dignity and necessity, these men are, quite literally, saviours of their families, holding economies together through ingenuity and resilience. Newspaper fragments woven into the composition document municipal police violence and vendor advocacy, refusing to let viewers aestheticize the suffering. By appropriating da Vinci's sacred iconography, Tafara makes a radical claim: that Black men engaged in survival labor possess a grace and nobility equal to religious figures. The work embodies the artist's core philosophy, that classical technique, when deployed in service of centering marginalized narratives, becomes a revolutionary act.

## Portrait of Rivaldo  
**Medium:** Pastel and acrylic on canvas  
**Dimensions:** 24 in × 36 in  
**Year:** 2025  

The first of four portrait studies serving as foundation for the *Madzimambo/Malords* series. This work documents Rivaldo's presence through a hybrid technical approach, pastels layered with acrylic, allowing for both delicate chromatic nuance and bold structural definition. As a study, it functions exploratively: Tafara tests how contemporary portraiture might position Black men within the visual language of European regalia and Renaissance composition. The work is intimate and observational, capturing not a posed performance but Rivaldo's authentic presence—his humanity, his vulnerability, his right to be rendered with the grandeur typically reserved for European nobility.  

---

## Portrait of Tinashe  
**Medium:** Pastel and acrylic on canvas  
**Dimensions:** 24 in × 36 in  
**Year:** 2025  

The second portrait in the *Madzimambo/Malords* research phase. This work furthers Tafara's exploration of how to render Black male subjects within classical art historical frameworks. Through combined pastels and acrylics, the artist captures Tinashe's character and presence, treating his face and form with the same reverence typically afforded to historical or mythological subjects. Each portrait study refines the artist's methodology, moving closer toward the fully realized *Madzimambo/Malords* vision: a visual canon in which Black men are sovereigns, uncompromised in their humanity and dignity.  

---

## Portrait of Tendekai  
**Medium:** Pastel on cotton rag paper  
**Dimensions:** 19 in × 25 in  
**Year:** 2025  

A technical and conceptual refinement within the *Madzimambo/Malords* studies. Working on cotton rag paper, a material traditionally associated with fine art and archival longevity, Tafara renders Tendekai's unique presence through soft pastel. The choice of material is deliberate: it asserts that these contemporary Black men are worthy of preservation, of archival status, of historical documentation. The intimacy of pastel on paper creates a different affective register than canvas, inviting closer viewing and deeper contemplation.  

---

## Portrait of Russell  
**Medium:** Pastel on cotton rag paper  
**Dimensions:** 19 in × 25 in  
**Year:** 2025  

The final portrait study in this phase of research. Russell's rendering on cotton rag paper consolidates Tafara's technical and conceptual approach. Through meticulous pastel work, the artist captures Russell's individuality, not as a generic "Black man," but as a particular human being with specific features, expressions, and interior life. These four portrait studies collectively represent Tafara's expanded artistic vision: portraiture as an act of documentation, dignity, and defiance. They are the scaffolding upon which *Madzimambo/Malords* will be built.

## God Bless The Black Girl V  
**Medium:** Pastels and newspaper on paper  
**Dimensions:** 16 in × 20 in  
**Year:** 2025  

A return to the series nearly four years after its apparent conclusion, this work signals artistic maturity and renewed conviction. Having proven through male-centered work that he could be a vessel and voice regardless of subject, Tafara returns to Black femininity with deeper philosophical grounding. This fifth iteration incorporates everything learned: the layering of newspaper fragments, the emotional depth of pastel, the integration of archival material as narrative context. The work affirms that centering Black women's narratives is not a limitation but a responsibility, one he is equipped to fulfill through his practice. *God Bless the Black Girl V* suggests that this series will continue, evolving with the artist's expanding vision and technical refinement.
